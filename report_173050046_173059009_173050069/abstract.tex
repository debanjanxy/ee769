Speech recognition is the process of recognizing the spoken words and converting it into machine readable format. In today's world it has become so popular that it is available today in every digital devices that we interact with. In this project we have implemented a speech recognition system using Tensorflow speech command dataset. We used raw spectrogram of audio as input to our model for 10 classes of words. We achieved average test accuracy of 78.23\%. We have used convolutional neural networks (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to implement our model. This allowed us to get deeper insights into how CNN and GRU works.
